 <p>I am 24 years old and I was originally a nursing major.  I grew up in the state of washington and in the last month I traveled 
    out of the state for the first time last month(december 2018).  I am currently engaged with the love of my life who I have been with nearly 7 years.
    I have long term goals of transferring to WGU in the next year for my bachelors in software development.</p>

 <p>Hello! My name is Chelsea Jansen. I have long term goals to become a front end web developer, and to hopefully develop games.
    I spend most of my time playing video games and snuggling my 2 cats.  I also stream on twitch occasionally whenever I have a chance
    inbetween classwork.</p>
