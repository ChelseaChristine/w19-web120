<h2>Galleries</h2>
<p>Galleries in the world of website design can be take many shapes.  From widgets you can<br> 
  create through different tools, to simple coding utilizing javascript or html, the <br> 
  opportunities are endless.  Galleries are nice to add a beatiful touch to a website and <br> 
  also a wonderful way to fit in more information on a page when in a mobile format.  <br> 
  For example, a photo gallery created for a modeling site would give the opportunity for <br> 
  the model to show off more examples of work by creating a gallery that someone can look <br> 
  through.  I have found though in my research that it is more common to utilize special <br> 
  tools online than coding directly, but that doesn't change the fact you can still code <br> 
  in a slider or gallery, including one specifically for mobile utilizing jquery.  <br> 
  There is even a helpful site in which it goes over the api for utilizing a slider in <br> 
  such a fashion.  Embedding such tools is also a common step taken, just like how someone<br> 
  might embed a youtube video then upload and use their own video hosting service.<br>  
  Doing this can simplify the process.<br>
