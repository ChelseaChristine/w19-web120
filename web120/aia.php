            This is the potential Employer or current Employer for the client. With the client being in the 
            technology field the Employer's will most likely have experience navigating a website. Depending on where they 
            are accessing the website, they might have access to high speed connections(if at work) on monitors or laptops.  This
            site would most likely not be viewed on a mobile device, but to have it responsive would still be ideal.

            Very similar to employers, but this audience might have a wide range of computer skills,
            from tech savvy to just learning how to turn on a computer.  As a business associate is traditionally older,
            the way they access the website could be from a pc, laptop, or mobile device.  This will most likely be a fairly 
            diverse group of people from different stages of life.  Most may on a decent speed for internet, but can change depending 
            on where they are viewing the website and how(mobile wifi vs pc hardwire).
